# Infrastructure
NixOS configuration for UMD Racing e.V. IT infrastructure

This repository aims to track the configuration of the IT infrastructure, using NixOS with Colmena for declarative system management. It is currently very much w.i.p. and more documentation will follow

## Rough plan

- NixOS as host system
- Colmena for deployment
- Sops-nix for secrets management
- Authentik for SSO for the various services
- Headscale for VPN configuration

## Setup

Will follow, probably via nix-develop

## Use
Enter the dev env with
```bash
$ nix develop -i
```
